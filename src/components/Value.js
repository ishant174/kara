        My career began as an Equity Research analyst on Wall St. I started the MBA program at NYU in the Fall of 2008, right as the market crashed, with Occupy Wall St. protests happening outside our campus doors. As often happens, times of crises create opportunity and I shifted my career focus from finance to marketing & entrepreneurship. I began my entrepreneurial journey with ups and downs and great learning - most importantly, discovering my passion and purpose in supporting women in elevating their voices and professional and personal success.
